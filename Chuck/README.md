### Homework
Design/train a MLP in mxnet 

1) Finish "TDDO" in "mxnet-week2/mlp_sym.py" and "train_mlp.py"
    
    "mx.sym.Convolution"
    "mx.sym.Activation"
    "mx.sym.Pooling"
    "mx.symbol.FullyConnected"
    "mx.sym.SoftmaxOutput"
	
2) Upload the network architecture you design to your repository
    
    The figure file(pdf, jpg, png ,etc) generated by mxnet 
    Hint: try "mx.sym.plot_network"

3) Compare the accuracy and the training time between MLP and CNN
    
    Fill the table of the comparison of two methods
     
	|Comparison              | MLP | Your Network
	
	|Acc(5 epoch)            |

	|CPU Epoch time          |
	
	|GPU Epoch Time(optional)|
